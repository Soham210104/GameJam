# MerryMakerMadness
We took part in a game jam called FestiveJam on itch.io, where the theme centered around "Santa's Little Helper" and we had to make that game in 7days. Our collaborative effort resulted in the creation of a 2D pixel game for Windows with the help of Unity Engine named Merry Maker Madness. The objective of the game is to craft gifts for children, with specific instructions on box and toy types displayed in the common room.
Player works on their product in the individual room and then places it on the table.We collaborated with each other with help of GitHub.
This game was made by a team of three.
Sahil Dhumane - Designer/Artist
Aman Gupta - Programmer
Me Soham Ovhal - Programmer

We ranked #10 out of #20 group team.
